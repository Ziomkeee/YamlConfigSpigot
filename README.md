# YamlConfigSpigot
I found it useful to share a piece of code responsible for creating countless yaml files. I noticed that beginners in creating Minecraft plugins have a problem with this, so I hope that this will at least make it easier for them to learn.

In the wiki I described most of the possibilities and instructions on how to use this code.

### How to use
1. Copy the [Config.java](https://github.com/Ziomkeee/YamlConfigSpigot/blob/master/src/main/java/pl/qdev/YamlConfigSpigot/Config.java) class into your project
2. View [wiki](https://github.com/Ziomkeee/YamlConfigSpigot/wiki)

### My recommendations:
 - Java 8
 - Spigot above version 1.8
